# Introducing FlowSync-vo1

https://flowsync-vo1.netlify.app/ - This is the link to FlowSync's very first version - flowsync-vo1

## About the product

FlowSync is built with the vision on helping teams track their progress and move in a flow, seemlessly. In the current version, which is a ****prototype****, it can track the progress of one individual only and can't store their data, nor does it have any database to store user information at all. All of these issues will be corrected in flowsync-vo2.

### How to use FlowSync-vo1

Simply click on the link above and start using it. It's as simple as that!

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Thank You
